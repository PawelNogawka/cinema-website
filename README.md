By creating this website, I learned how to do:

- Css grid menu
- A section that changes width when the user hovers over it using the flex-grow property
- The section where I used the fetch method in js to download the api needed to display the list of movies on the website
- Vertical Slider, using flex and transform properties
- Animated contact form.
- Animated search input using properties such as position and transform
